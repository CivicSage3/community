# Poll: Onboard ABC-token to Spork Protocol - JULY 24, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of Spork. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on MONDAY, JULY 24 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Outcomes
