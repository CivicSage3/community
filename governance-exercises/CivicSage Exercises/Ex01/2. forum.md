The Governance Facilitators propose structuring the changes to Spork listed by @Alice and @Faraz in three individual polls:
1. Adjust Spork DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) Debt parameters.
2. Increase Spork DAI deposit rate.
3. Onboard ABC Always Blue Coin (ABC) token to Spork Protocol. 
 
Those decisions should be submitted as separate polls as they carry different impact to the Maker Protocol.

The Governance Facilitators approve the three polls to move forward and will submit them through the weekly governance cycle.
