The Governance Facilitators propose structuring the changes to Spork listed by @Alice and @Faraz in three individual polls:
1. Modification of Sporkâ€™s DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) Debt parameters
2. Increase of DAI deposit rate on Spork from 2% to 2.5%
3. Onboarding of Always Blue Coin (ABC) token to Spork 
 
Those decisions should be submitted as separate polls as they carry different impact to the Maker Protocol. Due to their high impact and recurring nature, the first two polls will be managed within the [Weekly Governance Cycle](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance-processes/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle). As per the [Governance guidelines in MIP16c3](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP16#MIP16c3), the decision on onboarding of the ABC token on Spork will be managed within the [Monthly Governance Cycle](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance-processes/governance-cycle/monthly-governance-cycle).

Governance Facilitators approve the three polls to move forward in their current state. If any changes are made to the request for onboarding ABC token to Spork prior to the Formal Submission, the approval for this poll will need to be rectified by the consensus of Scope Facilitators.
