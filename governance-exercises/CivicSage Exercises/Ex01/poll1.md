### Poll 1
The Governance Facilitators have placed a [Governance Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance-processes/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle) into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of Spork, as per the power granted them in [MIP113.12.1.2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#12-3-aligned-delegate-bootstrapping-seasons).

This Governance Poll will be active for three days, beginning on Monday, July 24 at 16:00 UTC.


**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

#### Review
The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes in Spork’s DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) debt parameters:
- Increase Debt Ceiling from 50 million to 100 million DAI.
- Increase Target Available Debt (gap) from 5 million DAI to 15 million DAI.
- Increase Debt Cooldown from 28,800 seconds to 86,400 seconds.

If you’d like more information regarding the D3M and interaction of discussed debt parameters interact, please review the D3M documentation in the [Maker Operational Manual](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dai-direct-deposit).

#### Outcomes
If the “Yes” votes exceed the “No” votes, the following actions will be taken:
- The proposed parameter changes will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote.
- It is expected that the Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
