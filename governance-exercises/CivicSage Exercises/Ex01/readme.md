## Determine what course of action you would take as a Governance Facilitator and communicate it clearly

1. Review the poll request and related discussion to determine if everything is clear and nothing needs to be clarified.

2. Clarify with Alice and Faraz the addition of Debt Increase Cooldown parameter, as it was not included in Alice’s post, but only mentioned in the reply from Faraz.

3. Separate the request into three polls:
    - Modification of Spork’s D3M Debt parameters
        - Decision impacting directly Maker Core
        - A recurring operational decision to be managed via Weekly Governance Cycle
    - Increase of DAI deposit rate on Spork from 2% to 2.5%
        - Decision unrelated to D3M Debt parameters or ABC token
        - A recurring operational decision to be managed via Weekly Governance Cycle
    - Onboarding of ABC token to Spork
        - Decision seems to be internal to subDAO governance (new process to be followed after subDAO token launch?)
        - If applicable, it should be managed via Monthly Governance Cycle with Formal Submission done between August 7 and August 9 (as per the [Governance Calendar](https://manual.makerdao.com/resources/governance-calendar))

4. Make a forum post explaining the separation of request into three polls and the rationale behind it. Had we not had the reply from Bob and Faraz, I would have split the request from Alice into three forum posts. In this case, I’d leave the post as it is and only split the polls.

5. Make a forum post, explicitly approving the three poll requests, based on:
    - No/ low risk for Maker Ecosystem/ community.
    - They are approved by Support Scope Facilitator, responsible for authorizing Spork-related proposals.
    - They are approved by Faraz who employed relevant advisory teams to evaluate them.

6. Draft and post the three governance polls using:
    - Relevant templates (I could not find the repository).
    - Creation, review and submission checklists to ensure the polls are structured and written correctly.
    - Poll tag sheet to determine correct tagging.

7. Follow the remaining steps of the Governance process:
    - Weekly cycle: 
        - Close the poll on Friday, July 21. 
        - If the vote passes, confirm Executive Vote contents and deliver spell copy to Governance Security Advisory Council.
        - Add Executive Vote to the voting portal on Wednesday, August 2.
    - Monthly cycle: 
        - Coordinate Formal Submission between August 7 and August 9
        - If no changes are made to the original request, I'd consider it as approved by consensus of Scope Facilitators (Support, Stability, Governance). If any changes are made, I'd align with other Facilitators to ratify the approval.
        - Post MIP Ratification Poll on August 14.
        - Mark poll as accepted or rejected on Monday, August 28.
        - If the vote passes, add it to the Executive Vote on August 30.
